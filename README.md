# LA-project 

The goal of our project is to develop a simple machine learning model for the automatic classification of book genres based on their texts. We want to streamline the process of uploading books into a digital system, where each book must be assigned to an appropriate genre category.

To test our code, you first need to add some .txt format documents to the data/document folder. Once done, you are ready to go.
