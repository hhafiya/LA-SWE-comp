# LA-project Text Genre Classifier

The goal of our project is to develop a simple machine learning model for the automatic classification of book genres based on their texts. We want to streamline the process of uploading books into a digital system, where each book must be assigned to an appropriate genre category.

We use matrix factorization techniques, such as SVD, to generate static word embeddings. 
These embeddings are then fed into a text classifier based on a softmax model to predict
the genre of a given text.

To test our code, you first need to add some .txt format documents to the data/document folder. Once done, you are ready to go.
